# Hi, I'm Kasper

I graduated from Aalborg University in 2015 with a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering. Following that, I started on my Ph.D., also in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on cardiac mechanical contraction. I examined the method called Seismocardiography and defended my Ph.D. thesis in September 2020. As part of the Ph.D. I did a pilot study showing that Seismocardiography can be used in non-exercise VO2-max estimation. Based on this study I co-founded VentriJect. In VentriJect we develop and sell a small, non-inversive, non-exercise, device for easy VO2-max estimation. I currently work at the company as Head of Software.

I have a great interest in developing software and the combination with the medical device industry is ideal for me. Starting VentriJect have granted me insights into how to manage documents and the development process with respect to the European Medical Device Regulations.
